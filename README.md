This demo project demonstrates how to automate any postman collection by adding [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) as a library within a Javascript project. The following example runs a collection by reading a JSON collection file stored on the project directory.

As an example, the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org) open source project is used.

## Requirements

- This project requires [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run.

## Commands

```shell
npm install && npm run newman
```
